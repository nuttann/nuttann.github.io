Houses are roughly organized as described below. TS items may be useful in more than one
skill so this is not clean.  I did write a script to find items in more than one house
and I moved them.  The three house in the entry area (Market Street) are other stuff and
a mix of NODROP and tradable. Well some of the no drop ornaments could be packed into
a suit and made tradable if someone want them. I was too lazy to really try and sell stuff
a lot.

I never decorated houses, but did save drops and rewards in case someone wanted them. I
never got around to trying to give it out.

NOTE: If you move everything from here to RotE sometime, don't forget that guild leader of
the TS guild is one of the chars. If you don't want that guild, then you might see if anyone
wants one of their own.
