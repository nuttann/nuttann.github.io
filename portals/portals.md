# Guide to Porting using portals, clickies, and spells

This document will list zones that can be ported to using various
methods. These methods include the Guild Hall Teleportation Device,
specific portals spread around the RotE guild hall, personal clickies, and
spells.

Skip to [Zones](#zones)

## Guild Teleportation Device (G)

This is set by handing the Teleportation Assistant a specific portal crystal
for the destination zone. Once set, it remains that way until either someone
resets it or the zone is reset (no one in GH for some length of time or
sever reboot). He sells the portal crystals.

## Spells (D = Druid, W = Wizard)

In some cases, may be more convenient to where you want to go. With the addition
of the GH teleportation device and all the crate portal objects, there are often
equivalent or better choices than a porting class.

## Portal Objects (P)

There are several portal objects in the guild hall. Images showing the
general area and the specific item to right-click and select 'Teleport
to ZONE' are included. The images here were taken from the RotE guild
hall. Advantages of the Portal Objects are that you don't have to buy
something to set it and you don't have to change the Guild Port. This is
especially useful to avoid changing it during raid times.

Many of these portal objects may be used from inventory. When clicked from
inventory there is usually a long timeout. When placed in real estate, there
is no timeout and can also be used by others. For purposes of this document,
they will be listed under portals.

## Clickies (C)

There are are many clickies that players can use from inventory. Some are
found in game, some are included when buying certain versions of an
expansion, and some are rewards. (See Portal Object note above concerning
clickies)
