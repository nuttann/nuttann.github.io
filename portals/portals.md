# Guide to Porting using portals, clickies, and spells

This document will list zones that can be ported to using various
methods. These methods include the Guild Hall Teleportation Device,
other portals spread around the RotE guild hall, personal clickies, and
spells.

Skip to [Zones](#Zones)

## Guild Teleportation Device

This is set by handing the Teleportation Assistant a specific piece for
the destination zone. Once set, it remains that way until either someone
resets it or the zone is reset (no one in GH for some length of time or
sever reboot). He sells the necessary items to hand back to set the portal.

## Portal Objects

There are several portal objects in the guild hall. Images showing the
general area and the specific item to right-click and select 'Teleport
to ZONE' are included. The images here were taken from the RotE guild
hall.

## Clickies

There are are many clickies that players may use from inventory. Some are
found in game, some are included when buying certain versions of an
expansion, and some are rewards.
