# Collection item info

## Overview

I have been gathering collectibles since they were first introduced.  I am making them available to Return of the Exiled
guild members for no cost. There are some rules and instructions on how to request them. I have a script that reads the
'/output realestate' dump files and organizes them by house / expansion / quest / item for a web page. This should make it
easy to find. The house interface for extracting is not so nice and only lists items.

## Rules

- Items requested are for guild members only. They are not to be sold.
- These are for mains unless I have a lot of an item.
- I make an attempt to fair-share distribution of rares if I have multiple people requesting them at same time.
- I do this voluntarily, so requests should be done to make it easy for me.

## Donations

If you have extras that you don't need to save or sell and you want to donate them, I will take them. Note:
I only keep one stack (100) of an item. Anything over that, I drop on the ground.

## Requesting items

The following are instructions for requesting. There is information on these for why it is a requirement. If you want to know why,
click on the requirement to see more information. But, it basically boils down to making it easy to pull stuff out and be fair.

<details><summary>To request items send an in-game email to cazic.Nuttann (Note 2 n's at end.  
There is also a toon named 'Nuttan' on server.)</summary><p>
The in-game emails give me a simple place to find requests when I go to houses. Tells get lost in logs. Verbal will be forgotten.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Each request should be limited to 10 items per email.</summary><p>
This smaller number allows me to handle what I can depending on bag space and number of people I am handling requests for at one time.
I can handle one or more emails and then delete them so I can keep track. This also makes it easier to do 'fair share' distribution so
that more people get a shot at rarer items by allowing me to rotate through different people's emails.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Items must be grouped by house. State which house (E.g., "102 Vanward Street, Evantil's Abode")</summary><p>
I don't memorize where everything is.  I don't have time to look it up. And at the time of this document, there is one expansion
that is in multiple houses.  The type of house really helps because it is a visual clue when I am moving between houses. The address
makes it definitive.
</p></details>

<details><summary>One item per line.</summary><p>
From experience, it is much easier to keep track of where I am with this format.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Items must be listed individually.</summary><p>
Don't state all that I have from quest A as I won't be looking the quest up and doing that work for you.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Make sure I had at least one of each item when you requested.</summary><p>
It wastes time for me to check for an item that wasn't there when you checked.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Optional: List items in alphabetical order. (Your request will receive some preference.)</summary><p>
The house is one HUGE list of hundred of items in alphabetical order.  If your list is in alphabetical order, it makes it easier to
go scroll down through house exactly once.  Unfortuanately 'find item' doesn't work at this time. It does not show houses that I am
co-owner for and it doesn't show items that a co-owner placed in my houses.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Do not state expansion, zone, or quest name.</summary><p>
None of this info helps with the in-game house interface. And there were cases, I had to think about whether a line was a quest name
or an item.
