FYI I have both - Spec Alt and Spec Evok augs in. One mage I talked to, didn't
think they did much good anymore, and I haven't checked recently, but they used
to reduce mana costs in associated lines. (Some of our dots including Nature's use
Evok like nukes) I do have the other spec augs in bank if they every are useful enough.

   2 summon ranged item clickies that produce Druid usuable items for skill up
Bank6	Wayfarer's Pocketed Rucksack --- Old augments and purity augs
   Saved corruption augs in case that was really needed again
