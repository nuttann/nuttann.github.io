- [Sample Research worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aFZ9APvACfWYkWn3AZY7ds6Y7WGai6qOegeyeQLcHlE/edit?usp=sharing) - Sample worksheet of what I needed to do at one point.  It contains the item to be made and the recipe ingredients.  I would mark the done column with an X as I did one and then would sort A-Z on that column after doing a bunch. Todo items were at the end (first blank entry to end of file). Alternatively, once sorted you can delete the rows that you are done with. This form was nice as I could see ingredients and notice I needed N number of a certain scroll.  If I had a bunch of that scroll I would knock those off. (Worksheet was built with a script to extract the recipes from EQ Traders) Like EQ Traders, vendor sold items are marked with an "*".
