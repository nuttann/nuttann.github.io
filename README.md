# Everquest data - Nuttann - Cazic Thule server

- [Collection items](collection.html) - Collection items available for Return of the Exiled (RotE) guild members.
- [Guild Hall Portals](portals/portals.md) - Portal locations for RotE guild hall.
- [Achievements - TODO](achievements.md) - Achievements being worked on for Nuttann, Nanbus and Gallin. If you are interested in working on some of these with me, contact me.
- [Sample Research worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aFZ9APvACfWYkWn3AZY7ds6Y7WGai6qOegeyeQLcHlE/edit?usp=sharing) - Sample worksheet of what I needed to do at one point.  Would mark the done column with an X as I did one and then would sort A-Z on that column after doing a bunch. Todo items were at the end (first blank entry to end of file). Alternatively, once sorted you can delete the rows that you are done with. This form was nice as I could see ingreidents and notice I needed N number of a certain scroll.  If I had a bunch of that scroll I would knock those off. (Worksheet was built with a script) Like EQ Traders, vendor sold items are marked with an "*".
